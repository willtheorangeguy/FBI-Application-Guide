# FBI Application Guide
This is a little guide that I put together to make it easier to see the requirements to become and FBI Special Agent.

The guide is sorted into a folder for each step of the application process. Refer to the image above for more information, or to the folder structure below.
```
├── Step1
|   ├── 1-1 - How to Apply and Submit an Application.docx
|   ├── 1-2 - Federal Resume Guide.docx
|   └── 1-3 - FAQ.docx
├── 0 - Title and Contents.docx
└── README.md
```

As you can probably see, I have not gotten very far as I started the project only a little while ago. 

## Format
All the documents are Microsoft Word docs that can be opened with either [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) or [Microsoft Office](https://products.office.com/en-ca/products).
If you want to make changes, please make sure that you follow the format that has already been established.
