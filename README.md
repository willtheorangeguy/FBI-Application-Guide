# FBI Application Guide
This is a little guide that I put together to make it easier to see the requirements to become and FBI Special Agent.

![Application Process](https://www.fbijobs.gov/sites/default/files/FBI_Graphic_ApplicationProcess_SpecialAgent_Website_943x551-min.png)
The guide is sorted into a folder for each step of the application process. Refer to the image above for more information, or to the folder structure below.
